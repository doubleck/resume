When we started working together, I asked if he had ever used version control. He had never heard of it, but that night he made his first git commit. Our collaboration took off from there.  He is also very passionate about his work. We've spent weekends together programming, just for fun. His passion for learning truly inspires me to learn as well. All around a fantastic team member to have."
